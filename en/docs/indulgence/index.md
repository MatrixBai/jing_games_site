## Game Overview
*Indulgence: The Compass Finds Home* is a narrative sandbox on a barren border world. You play as the captain of the retired ferry ship *Dandelion*, exiled here against your will. To shorten your sentence and leave this place, you must gather pardon coupons—they are valuable, but first you need looking for the people who owns them.

Your ship can reach every corner of the planet. Recruit some crew, trade goods, and sign contracts—then manage morale, supplies, and dangers to stay ahead. Home is possible, but it will not be easy. Find out for yourself.
