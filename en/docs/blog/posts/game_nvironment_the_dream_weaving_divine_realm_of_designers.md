Today, let's continue taking about game scene design.

**Visual Elements Pulling at Memories** 
Scenes are one of the most powerful elements in creating spatial atmosphere. In a game's interior spaces, those carefully presented visual elements directly pull players deep into their memories—familiar recollections, scenes, and the surging emotions from back then. <!-- more -->

For example, facing an empty room, I always feel an eager impulse to fill it up completely.

Unlike the real world, adding anything here doesn't cost real money—this is both the designer's happiest privilege and the easiest trap to get lost in: you can place anything, arrange whatever you want freely. In this space, without exaggeration, you are a god.

**Designing from the Character's Perspective** 

Of course, the prerequisite for being a god is "every placement should serve the player experience." When actually designing interiors, we certainly consider from the character's perspective, carefully examining their feelings in it—otherwise, we can't convey the experience we truly want to give players.

Because players are both role-playing the in-game character, yet their physical body is outside in reality. In other words, players can simultaneously experience the dual identities of "character" and "god," and this switch flows naturally during gameplay based on the player's needs.

Generally, the closer a game's building interiors are to the real world, the easier it is for players to feel immersed, as if they are truly there.

**The Charm of Controllable Dreams** 
This feeling is intuitive and real; to some extent, it resembles a dream experience. We love this dream because in games, it becomes controllable and manageable through mastering the rules.

Those artistically processed interiors incorporating a specific style bring a magical feeling beyond reality. This unreal immersion comes from abstract refinement of reality, yet it's not entirely fictional.

Most visual guidance is to stimulate active processing in the player's brain—making it easier for them to learn game rules that differ greatly from real physical laws, without feeling any dissonance.

Thanks to the game world for providing us designers with such an infinitely vast space for dreaming.
