In sci-fi films, there’s always that unforgettable scene: a spaceship hits a crisis, hibernation pods creak open, and the sleepers inside emerge, struggling awake from viscous liquid, coughing, gasping. These “aged infants,” in their half-dreaming, half-waking moment, flash a glimmer of bewilderment in their eyes, as if a thousand years of time condense into a single instant.<!-- more -->

I often lose myself in these cinematic details, letting my thoughts slip into those fictional worlds, lingering briefly in the realm of imagination. I wonder: what changes would a mind, having wandered through countless dreams during a long slumber, undergo when warped by time and space?

In game UI aesthetics, despite the constraints of limited screen space, I’m committed to weaving in the art style of dieselpunk. Unlike steampunk’s optimistic nostalgia, dieselpunk sheds ornate embellishments for a raw, desolate edge. It carries a unique tension, as if whispering the complex emotions born from the clash of humanity and machinery.

In a distant future—or perhaps a retro parallel universe—dieselpunk ignites the imagination of a “retro-futuristic” world with its rugged yet romantic flair. Far from the neon-drenched, cold high-tech of cyberpunk, dieselpunk crafts a gritty, captivating realm with brass, rivets, and the roar of engines.

With the courage and ingenuity to conquer the stars, humanity forged tools to explore new worlds. These machines bear the marks of our earliest fusion with technology. Their designs evoke a strange familiarity—like the armor of ancient knights reborn, with bold, sturdy curves that encase fragile human forms, radiating a beauty both powerful and vulnerable. This aesthetic not only lends games a distinct visual language but also immerses players in the wondrous experience of human-machine symbiosis during interaction.

（The roots of dieselpunk trace back to the early 20th-century industrial era, drawing inspiration from the mechanical aesthetics of World War II—think vintage airships, rugged tanks, and pilots sporting goggles. At its core, dieselpunk is about an “outdated future,” blending early 20th-century technological fantasies with modern design language to create a look that’s both familiar and alien.）
