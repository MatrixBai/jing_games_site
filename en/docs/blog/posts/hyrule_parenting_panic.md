Most of the time, I’m the designated “gaming buddy” for our kid playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, because when Dad steps in, she feels like she’s under “colossal pressure.” That day, I had some stuff to handle, so I specifically asked Dad to take over the gaming duties. Sure enough, it wasn’t long before the familiar sound of “bickering” echoed from the living room. I peeked in and caught a hilarious family mini-drama unfolding over “game coaching.”<!-- more -->

The screen was frozen on a Hyrule hillside, with Link panting his way up a climb, his stamina bar teetering on empty. Our kid, controlling Link, spotted some rushrooms on a cliff and excitedly veered off course. Dad, eyeing the nearly depleted stamina bar, furrowed his brow and barked, “Forget those rushrooms! Climb up already!” Under Dad’s “command,” the kid reluctantly complied, though she kept stealing longing glances at those mushrooms.

When I finished my tasks and rejoined them, we held a little “post-game debrief.” Our daughter, with theatrical flair, mimicked Dad’s “commander” tone: “Forget those rushrooms, climb!” She waved her arms dramatically, sending us into fits of laughter. Dad scratched his head, a bit sheepish, and admitted, “Okay, maybe I was too intense. I forgot she just wants to have fun.”

This parent-child gaming session made me realize how different player types can be. As a mom, I totally get our kid’s newbie mindset—the fear of the unknown, the curiosity about tiny details. I remember when I first played games, picking up a flower or spotting an animal would thrill me for ages. Dad, the veteran gamer, is all about efficiency and achievements, itching to unlock shrines and push the story forward. We have different expectations: I want our kid to explore freely and savor the journey; Dad wants to lead her straight to the finish line.

These differences created a fun “chemical reaction” during our gaming sessions. Our kid’s obsession with picking mushrooms reminded me of the pure joy of being a newbie, while Dad’s “speedrun” mentality kept things moving and taught her how to play more efficiently. Sure, there were occasional clashes—like her quiet frustration when Dad rushed her—but more often, our styles complemented each other. Everyone’s pace deserves respect, and great game design should honor every player’s rhythm. Newbies need space to discover, veterans need goals to conquer, and the joy of playing together lies in finding that balance.
