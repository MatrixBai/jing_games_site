I’m thinking, if I were someone who’d never written a thing, clueless about stringing words together, the moment I saw this “opening words”  appear online, I’d probably be dancing with joy, waving my arms like a kid who just discovered candy.

Yep, my mind drifts back to a summer over twenty years ago. The internet was this shiny new toy, and blogs?  It was like the gates of a new world had cracked open just a sliver, letting out a teasing beam of light. And me? I dove in headfirst, brimming with excitement.

Compared to painting, words feel like my old pals—maybe because expressing the same feelings through text gets way more reactions than a brushstroke. Our “visual world” is bombarded with images every day. A painting? It’s usually gone in a second, your brain barely registering it before the next one—or the one after that—steals the spotlight. I don’t know if other artists feel this same pang of futility, but as I type this, that feeling’s hitting me hard. And you know what? I’m okay with sitting in that powerlessness for a bit. It’s real, raw, and there’s no need to sweep it under the rug.

If this piece started with my experience as an artist, it might go something like this: If I were someone who couldn’t draw a stick figure, I’d still be bursting with pride showing off a matchstick man in a video game. I’m not here to rehash the opening, though—just marveling that even with all my years of painting experience, I’m finally at a place where I can feel joy for every little thing I create.

When it comes to the art of our game  *INDULGENCE*, the journey began a decade ago with the first spark of an idea. From that moment, I set off on an unknown adventure. Only years later, looking back at that starting point, did I begin to see the true me who took that first step. Suddenly, the urge to share came rushing back into my veins. I know I’m ready, buzzing with anticipation to meet you all here.
