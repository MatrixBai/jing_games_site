The internet was this shiny new toy, and blogs?  It was like the gates of a new world had cracked open just a sliver, letting out a teasing beam of light. And me? I dove in headfirst, brimming with excitement.</p> <p>Compared to painting, words feel like my old pals\u2014maybe because expressing the same feelings through text gets way more reactions than a brushstroke. Our \u201cvisual world\u201d is bombarded with images every day. A painting? It\u2019s usually gone in a second, your brain barely registering it before the next one\u2014or the one after that\u2014steals the spotlight. I don\u2019t know if other artists feel this same pang of futility, but as I type this, that feeling\u2019s hitting me hard. And you know what? I\u2019m okay with sitting in that powerlessness for a bit. It\u2019s real, raw, and there\u2019s no need to sweep it under the rug.</p> <p>If this piece started with my experience as an artist, it might go something like this: If I were someone who couldn\u2019t draw a stick figure, I\u2019d still be bursting with pride showing off a matchstick man in a video game. I\u2019m not here to rehash the opening, though\u2014just marveling that even with all my years of painting experience, I\u2019m finally at a place where I can feel joy for every little thing I create.</p> <p>When it comes to the art of our game  INDULGENCE, the journey began a decade ago with the first spark of an idea. From that moment, I set off on an unknown adventure. Only years later, looking back at that starting point, did I begin to see the true me who took that first step. Suddenly, the urge to share came rushing back into my veins. I know I\u2019m ready, buzzing with anticipation to meet you all here.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/the-first-post/","title":"The First Post","text":"<p>Dear DevLog,</p> <p>We are Yukai and Loomi, a couple who spent years creating our game Indulgence. This is the first letter to you, and it's long overdue. I know we should have been here from the start, writing down every bit of the game, sharing our joy, frustration, and even anger along the way. But why didn't we?</p> <p>The truth is, we were scared. Fear held us back\u2014fear that our game isn\u2019t good enough, that we aren\u2019t good enough. I can give you many reasons for our long-time absence: we are not native English speakers, we are too busy, the game is not in good shape yet, or the long grind drained our confidence and vitality. But deep in our hearts, I know they're all excuses; we are not honest enough to face you or ourselves. Now we're choosing the right path, starting with this letter.</p> <p>Writing feels old-fashioned in a world of short videos, and few people used to read large paragraphs of text anymore. That's okay, it's not about promotion. Writing helps us untangle our jumbled thoughts and put them in order. It\u2019s cheap, quick, and honest, free from the temptation to sugarcoat things for likes. For you, it\u2019s easier to digest\u2014no pausing a video to catch up. This is our space to reflect, to face our journey head-on.</p> <p>We're self-taught developers, which explains why it took so long to develop. We do believe our game has some creative sparks, but I am not sure if all the shining points can make it a fun game. Even right now, I can only say the toughest parts are done, but there are still many things to do before it's playable. We're not even sure who our players are yet. We thought players who enjoy Dwarf Fortress might also like our story generator. For now, we leave the game details for later, before the rising anxiety makes me unable to write.</p> <p>This letter is our hello, to let you know we're ready to face you. We will write more to explain our game, share our highs and lows, and hopefully, to show you the playable version of the game. See you soon, and thank you for your patience.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Yukai &amp; Loomi</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""}]}
