Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t long before the familiar sound of \u201cbickering\u201d echoed from the living room. I peeked in and caught a hilarious family mini-drama unfolding over \u201cgame coaching.\u201d</p> <p>The screen was frozen on a Hyrule hillside, with Link panting his way up a climb, his stamina bar teetering on empty. Our kid, controlling Link, spotted some rushrooms on a cliff and excitedly veered off course. Dad, eyeing the nearly depleted stamina bar, furrowed his brow and barked, \u201cForget those rushrooms! Climb up already!\u201d Under Dad\u2019s \u201ccommand,\u201d the kid reluctantly complied, though she kept stealing longing glances at those mushrooms.</p> <p>When I finished my tasks and rejoined them, we held a little \u201cpost-game debrief.\u201d Our daughter, with theatrical flair, mimicked Dad\u2019s \u201ccommander\u201d tone: \u201cForget those rushrooms, climb!\u201d She waved her arms dramatically, sending us into fits of laughter. Dad scratched his head, a bit sheepish, and admitted, \u201cOkay, maybe I was too intense. I forgot she just wants to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>This parent-child gaming session made me realize how different player types can be. As a mom, I totally get our kid\u2019s newbie mindset\u2014the fear of the unknown, the curiosity about tiny details. I remember when I first played games, picking up a flower or spotting an animal would thrill me for ages. Dad, the veteran gamer, is all about efficiency and achievements, itching to unlock shrines and push the story forward. We have different expectations: I want our kid to explore freely and savor the journey; Dad wants to lead her straight to the finish line.</p> <p>These differences created a fun \u201cchemical reaction\u201d during our gaming sessions. Our kid\u2019s obsession with picking mushrooms reminded me of the pure joy of being a newbie, while Dad\u2019s \u201cspeedrun\u201d mentality kept things moving and taught her how to play more efficiently. Sure, there were occasional clashes\u2014like her quiet frustration when Dad rushed her\u2014but more often, our styles complemented each other. Everyone\u2019s pace deserves respect, and great game design should honor every player\u2019s rhythm.

I focus first on the building\u2019s overall imagery \u2014 how its appearance expresses its unique character and function. But one question has haunted me the whole time: Does the exterior shell need to strictly match the interior in perspective?</p> <p>The biggest obstacle is the camera zoom: as it pulls in, the outer shell \u201cdisappears,\u201d revealing the interior. In 2D, this is even more dramatic \u2014 the shell fades, and the room jumps forward. This means the exterior\u2019s detail level must roughly match the refinement of large furniture when viewed up close. That logic drove me crazy for a while, constantly doubting whether my detail was right.</p> <p>From Experiments to Perspective Breakthrough</p> <p>I did countless exterior tests and realized single-point perspective didn\u2019t work \u2014 buildings appear in different parts of the frame but all need the same perspective direction, with interior and exterior layering consistently.</p> <p>After many tries, I adopted scattered perspective and dynamic viewing from Chinese painting. It solved the problem beautifully: no matter where a building sits on screen, everything feels unified and natural. </p> <p>From Side-View to Orthographic: The Hard Shift to Real Depth</p> <p>Early on we used side-view: houses \u201copen\u201d to show 2D interiors like Oxygen Not Included. But walls and foreground objects overlapped badly \u2014 the image felt cramped with almost no sense of space.  I looked at Starbound\u2019s pixel scenes (gorgeous, but not my strength). Eventually I returned to what I\u2019m good at: orthographic perspective \u2014 rooms with floors and matching exterior perspective, finally achieving real interior-exterior consistency.</p> <p></p> <p>Trade-offs in God\u2019s-eye View</p> <p>Players act as \u201cGod\u201d and need global overview, so pure linear side-scrolling felt too restrictive. We extended the ground plane, placing linear scenes on a larger flat surface.</p> <p>Still, we refused the standard solution (Stardew Valley-style separation) and stuck to our perspective. This forced lots of unconventional adjustments to pathfinding, item placement, and generation mechanics \u2014 all to create a fresh visual language instead of copying others.  Bottleneck &amp; Compromise: Exterior\u2013Interior Separation</p> <p>For large scenes and villages, I first tried scattered or top-down perspective for consistent space when houses open. It failed: every building became a boring square block with zero personality.</p> <p>Stuck, I drew tons of wild shapes just to feel unstuck. Finally I decided to fully separate them: exteriors use frontal presentation for strong silhouette and recognizability, no longer tied to the interior structure. Not perfect, but it felt like real relief. Looking Back</p> <p>This whole journey took enormous effort and carried me through confusion \u2192 experimentation \u2192 persistence \u2192 acceptance.</p> <p>The biggest change in me: I no longer chase the \u201cone correct answer.\u201d There is no absolute right path \u2014 only the one you choose, and the most meaningful thing is to walk it as beautifully and thoroughly as you can.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/17/indulgence-character-visual-design/","title":"Indulgence Character Visual Design","text":"<p>Character visual design is the part closest to players\u2019 hearts in a game.

They cannot use the item that does not belong to them.</li> <li>Social Hierarchy System: NPCs have different social statuses, and there is also a mechanic that allows them to change their position in society.</li> <li>Magic System: magic is real in this world.</li> <li>Family System: NPCs have family relationships in this world.</li> </ul> <p>The above list are not the final, I can list many more: Memory System, the brother and the sister must remember the things they keen to do; Evolve System, after the sister changed the forehead of her brother, the history in this world changed a lot, we need this system to get what exactly the result is; etc.</p> <p>Of course, we can implement it with pre-written scripted events. However, that would eliminate the 99.99% possibilities created by chemical effects among subsystems. Lose all the charm of the deep system.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys are crazy! How dare you create a Matrix! Nobody would play such a sophisticated game!\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, I hear your scream. Unlike in other game genres, players need to know the system as much as possible. NSG does not have such a requirement. The players only need to know the rules of how to play, or not.</p> <p>The last question is, how deep is the deep system? Is the The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild deep system design? The depth of its element system is surely beyond most games in the genre. I do not believe it qualifies as a narrative sandbox game. Honestly, I lack a clear standard for defining it and am relying solely on my sense of the depth and breadth of its subsystems. I hope to have a clear standard established in the future.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#open-rules-of-play","title":"Open Rules of Play","text":"<p>Every game has rules that govern what players can or cannot do, shaping how they win or lose. The Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) are no different; players learn the rules and play them. But the most unique characteristic of the rules in Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) is \u00a0No Fixed Ruleset.</p> <p>As a transdisciplinary traditional mechanical genre, Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) doesn\u2019t have its own game rules. We can create an NSG based on any mature genres. For example, Kenshi is an RPG; Dwarf Fortress and RimWorld are Colony Sim (the most popular ruleset in NSG); Crusader Kings is grand strategy; The Sims is life simulation. This unique character opened a gateway, enabling us to convert any traditional game genre into Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG).</p> <p>An Example</p> <p>In the NSG version of StarCraft, players can browse the background of every unit. One day, the player discovered that a marine named Ryan lost three brothers, leaving him as the family\u2019s last surviving son. Out of mercy, the player wants to keep Ryan alive for his parents. However, he has already been sent into the heartland of Zerg territory and lost contact due to the fog of war. The player assembled an elite team aimed to save Marine Ryan.</p> <p>The above clumsy imitation reveals the tremendous potential of combining traditional game mechanics with sophisticated system design.</p> <p>The Great Fault Tolerance is another unique characteristic of the rules in Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG). In most games, losing is frustrating and keeps players repeating the same gaming process until they beat it. Such things would not happen in Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG). Of course, I don't mean to say that narrative sandbox games are all simple and that players will never fail. In fact, the opposite is true. If measured by the standards of traditional mechanism games, most of them have a certain degree of difficulty, and players' gaming experiences are often accompanied by failure.</p> <p>!!! quote \u201cMotto in Dwarf Fortress\" The losing is fun.</p> <p>In NSG, the player can define their own loss and win conditions. The loss in other games here is treated as a different gaming branch. Some unique joy of the game can often only be experienced through losing. This is also why game streamers love these types of games\u2014failure in the game often leads to unexpected entertainment value.</p> <p>In Crusader Kings, the player can be a good ruler through mastering all the rules. If the player is overwhelmed by the complicated system, wasted years in the game and did nothing remarkable, then watching the kingdom fall can also be another kind of experience. Remember what I said before? The lack of knowledge about how to play would not be an issue for players; it can become a meaningful part of their gaming journey.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#emergent-story","title":"Emergent Story","text":"<p>Finally, we reach the top layer of Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG), the final product of gameplay, The Story.

The moment you start naming something new, it\u2019s like you\u2019re holding the reins of destiny\u2014thrilling, yet terrifying, as if one wrong move could tank everything. So, you tread lightly, right? I\u2019ve thumbed through countless design books, but when it\u2019s time to tackle a real project, my brain just stalls, and all my clever ideas vanish into thin air. I used to envy those slick designers who could rattle off case studies, laying out how they meticulously crafted a killer product. Only later did I realize those moments I coveted were just curated snippets of the design hustle\u2014my idealized version of work, not the gritty reality.</p> <p>A few days ago, I got this sudden urge to design a logo for our Jing Games Studio. Maybe it was the lingering inspiration from my recent trip to Japan\u2019s Seto Inland Sea, where those intricate Japanese patterns were still swirling in my head. Coincidentally, I\u2019d just flipped through a quirky Japanese design book, and its pattern section sparked some fleeting, unshakable inspiration.</p> <p>Clinging to those faint vibes, I felt compelled to do something. But the second I started sketching, that familiar frustration came roaring back. This time, though, as I began drawing the logo, a strange heaviness crashed over me, layering onto that initial sense of grandeur. It was like I\u2019d morphed into a solemn judge wielding a pen, every stroke deciding the life or death of some cosmic fate. Under this weight, every move felt stiff, every bold idea like it was headed for the creative chopping block. It was as if the world split open, and I was a lone needle stuck in the gap\u2014unable to move forward or back, stewing in a self-inflicted sense of despair.</p> <p>But let\u2019s be real: this is just a logo sketch, a flat image. It could be as simple as a circle. Whatever it is, it\u2019s just a starting point, not a destiny-altering blockbuster. Everything exists for a reason, so no matter what this logo ends up looking like, it\u2019ll fulfill its purpose. And fulfilling that purpose? That\u2019s its own kind of triumph.</p> <p>Note: This is just a design sketch, meant to capture my shifting mindset during the process, not the final logo for Jing Games Studio.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"indulgence/","title":"Indulgence The Compass Finds Home","text":""},{"location":"indulgence/#game-overview","title":"Game Overview","text":"<p>Indulgence: The Compass Finds Home is a narrative sandbox on a barren border world.
