These \u201caged infants,\u201d in their half-dreaming, half-waking moment, flash a glimmer of bewilderment in their eyes, as if a thousand years of time condense into a single instant.</p> <p>I often lose myself in these cinematic details, letting my thoughts slip into those fictional worlds, lingering briefly in the realm of imagination. I wonder: what changes would a mind, having wandered through countless dreams during a long slumber, undergo when warped by time and space?</p> <p>In game UI aesthetics, despite the constraints of limited screen space, I\u2019m committed to weaving in the art style of dieselpunk. Unlike steampunk\u2019s optimistic nostalgia, dieselpunk sheds ornate embellishments for a raw, desolate edge. It carries a unique tension, as if whispering the complex emotions born from the clash of humanity and machinery.</p> <p>In a distant future\u2014or perhaps a retro parallel universe\u2014dieselpunk ignites the imagination of a \u201cretro-futuristic\u201d world with its rugged yet romantic flair. Far from the neon-drenched, cold high-tech of cyberpunk, dieselpunk crafts a gritty, captivating realm with brass, rivets, and the roar of engines.</p> <p>With the courage and ingenuity to conquer the stars, humanity forged tools to explore new worlds. These machines bear the marks of our earliest fusion with technology. Their designs evoke a strange familiarity\u2014like the armor of ancient knights reborn, with bold, sturdy curves that encase fragile human forms, radiating a beauty both powerful and vulnerable. This aesthetic not only lends games a distinct visual language but also immerses players in the wondrous experience of human-machine symbiosis during interaction.</p> <p>\uff08The roots of dieselpunk trace back to the early 20th-century industrial era, drawing inspiration from the mechanical aesthetics of World War II\u2014think vintage airships, rugged tanks, and pilots sporting goggles. At its core, dieselpunk is about an \u201coutdated future,\u201d blending early 20th-century technological fantasies with modern design language to create a look that\u2019s both familiar and alien.\uff09</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/06/something-is-coming/","title":"Something Is Coming","text":"<p>I\u2019m thinking, if I were someone who\u2019d never written a thing, clueless about stringing words together, the moment I saw this \u201copening words\u201d  appear online, I\u2019d probably be dancing with joy, waving my arms like a kid who just discovered candy.</p> <p>Yep, my mind drifts back to a summer over twenty years ago. The internet was this shiny new toy, and blogs?  It was like the gates of a new world had cracked open just a sliver, letting out a teasing beam of light. And me? I dove in headfirst, brimming with excitement.</p> <p>Compared to painting, words feel like my old pals\u2014maybe because expressing the same feelings through text gets way more reactions than a brushstroke. Our \u201cvisual world\u201d is bombarded with images every day. A painting? It\u2019s usually gone in a second, your brain barely registering it before the next one\u2014or the one after that\u2014steals the spotlight. I don\u2019t know if other artists feel this same pang of futility, but as I type this, that feeling\u2019s hitting me hard. And you know what? I\u2019m okay with sitting in that powerlessness for a bit. It\u2019s real, raw, and there\u2019s no need to sweep it under the rug.</p> <p>If this piece started with my experience as an artist, it might go something like this: If I were someone who couldn\u2019t draw a stick figure, I\u2019d still be bursting with pride showing off a matchstick man in a video game. I\u2019m not here to rehash the opening, though\u2014just marveling that even with all my years of painting experience, I\u2019m finally at a place where I can feel joy for every little thing I create.</p> <p>When it comes to the art of our game  INDULGENCE, the journey began a decade ago with the first spark of an idea. From that moment, I set off on an unknown adventure. Only years later, looking back at that starting point, did I begin to see the true me who took that first step. Suddenly, the urge to share came rushing back into my veins. I know I\u2019m ready, buzzing with anticipation to meet you all here.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/the-first-post/","title":"The First Post","text":"<p>Dear DevLog,</p> <p>We are Yukai and Loomi, a couple who spent years creating our game Indulgence. This is the first letter to you, and it's long overdue. I know we should have been here from the start, writing down every bit of the game, sharing our joy, frustration, and even anger along the way. But why didn't we?</p> <p>The truth is, we were scared. Fear held us back\u2014fear that our game isn\u2019t good enough, that we aren\u2019t good enough. I can give you many reasons for our long-time absence: we are not native English speakers, we are too busy, the game is not in good shape yet, or the long grind drained our confidence and vitality. But deep in our hearts, I know they're all excuses; we are not honest enough to face you or ourselves. Now we're choosing the right path, starting with this letter.</p> <p>Writing feels old-fashioned in a world of short videos, and few people used to read large paragraphs of text anymore. That's okay, it's not about promotion. Writing helps us untangle our jumbled thoughts and put them in order. It\u2019s cheap, quick, and honest, free from the temptation to sugarcoat things for likes. For you, it\u2019s easier to digest\u2014no pausing a video to catch up. This is our space to reflect, to face our journey head-on.</p> <p>We're self-taught developers, which explains why it took so long to develop. We do believe our game has some creative sparks, but I am not sure if all the shining points can make it a fun game. Even right now, I can only say the toughest parts are done, but there are still many things to do before it's playable. We're not even sure who our players are yet. We thought players who enjoy Dwarf Fortress might also like our story generator. For now, we leave the game details for later, before the rising anxiety makes me unable to write.</p> <p>This letter is our hello, to let you know we're ready to face you. We will write more to explain our game, share our highs and lows, and hopefully, to show you the playable version of the game. See you soon, and thank you for your patience.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Yukai &amp; Loomi</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/","title":"The Narrative Sandbox Game","text":"<p>Indulgence, the game we are developing, is a Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG). Unlike ACT, RPG, or Rogue-lite, which are more approachable for mainstream players. The Narrative Sandbox is primarily targeted for dedicated players, as many mainstream gamers are unfamiliar with it. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to introduce the genre of Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) before discussing our own game.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#the-name","title":"The Name","text":"<p>I created the term Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG), which is why a Google search will tell you little information. The concept is the same as Story Generator (first used by RimWorld in my memory) or Emergent Narrative. They are good names, but to me, they fail to describe the unique characters of the game we are talking about. The Story Generator can be easily confused with the trending AI writer, let people focus on the final narrative product instead of the game. And the Emergent Narrative, excluding its academic term flavour, every game genre could have its emergent moment.</p> <p>I use the term NSG to describe this game genre--a sandbox full of narrative bits. In gameplay, players are in the story created by the game system and themselves. Each story is unique; no one can get the same story twice.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#the-core-features","title":"The Core Features","text":"<p>So, we have the name, but what exactly does the name represent? From bottom to top, we can find THREE core features in all of them.</p> <ul> <li>Deep System Design</li> <li>Open Rules of Play</li> <li>Emergent Narrative</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#deep-system-design","title":"Deep System Design","text":"<p>If you have some knowledge of game design, you could agree that each game is a self-consistent system. Even though the games lack much interaction, like a walking simulator, or the games focus on art expression, they are also a small system.</p> <p>The depth of the core system in most games is shallow because the designer wants players to understand the system easily and quickly. Players control Mario running and jumping, free from the complexities of Princess Peach\u2019s political rivals in the Mushroom Kingdom. Developers find it intuitive to design and build, while every player can enjoy a seamless and engaging experience. Sounds perfect, right?</p> <p>Usually, the answer would be affirmative. But for some curious souls, the small core system could easily make them bored. They are hungry for more. \u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The Revenge of Big Forehead</p> <p>There is an NPC. What does he look like? His big forehead makes him look like an ape and uglier than others. The unattractive outlook spawned hatred and envy to others and twisted his mind. He swore there would be a bloody sacrifice when he got the magic stone on the crown of the king. His sister knew his plan, and she loves her brother and wants to save him. She got the magic stone before her brother and made a wish to shrink the forehead bone of his brother when he was born. All of a sudden, the hatred spawned by the bigger forehead bone is gone. Everybody has a happy ending.</p> <p>In a game with deep system design, to make the above story possible, we need to implement multiple subsystems.</p> <ul> <li>Body Traits System, a bigger forehead could be a special trait applied to the body. Furthermore, we can replace it with a more intricately designed body system with additional details. Which contains bone, muscle and skin, and a user can adjust each part as needed.</li> <li>Aesthetic Opinion System: NPC can distinguish between ugliness and beauty in this world.</li> <li>Psycho System: Negative thoughts can corrupt the mind of an NPC.</li> <li>Property System: NPC can own items in this world. They cannot use the item that does not belong to them.</li> <li>Social Hierarchy System: NPCs have different social statuses, and there is also a mechanic that allows them to change their position in society.</li> <li>Magic System: magic is real in this world.</li> <li>Family System: NPCs have family relationships in this world.</li> </ul> <p>The above list are not the final, I can list many more: Memory System, the brother and the sister must remember the things they keen to do; Evolve System, after the sister changed the forehead of her brother, the history in this world changed a lot, we need this system to get what exactly the result is; etc.</p> <p>Of course, we can implement it with pre-written scripted events. However, that would eliminate the 99.99% possibilities created by chemical effects among subsystems. Lose all the charm of the deep system.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys are crazy! How dare you create a Matrix! Nobody would play such a sophisticated game!\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, I hear your scream. Unlike in other game genres, players need to know the system as much as possible. NSG does not have such a requirement. The players only need to know the rules of how to play, or not.</p> <p>The last question is, how deep is the deep system? Is the The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild deep system design? The depth of its element system is surely beyond most games in the genre. I do not believe it qualifies as a narrative sandbox game. Honestly, I lack a clear standard for defining it and am relying solely on my sense of the depth and breadth of its subsystems. I hope to have a clear standard established in the future.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#open-rules-of-play","title":"Open Rules of Play","text":"<p>Every game has rules that govern what players can or cannot do, shaping how they win or lose. The Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) are no different; players learn the rules and play them. But the most unique characteristic of the rules in Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) is \u00a0No Fixed Ruleset.</p> <p>As a transdisciplinary traditional mechanical genre, Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG) doesn\u2019t have its own game rules. We can create an NSG based on any mature genres. For example, Kenshi is an RPG; Dwarf Fortress and RimWorld are Colony Sim (the most popular ruleset in NSG); Crusader Kings is grand strategy; The Sims is life simulation. This unique character opened a gateway, enabling us to convert any traditional game genre into Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG).</p> <p>An Example</p> <p>In the NSG version of StarCraft, players can browse the background of every unit. One day, the player discovered that a marine named Ryan lost three brothers, leaving him as the family\u2019s last surviving son. Out of mercy, the player wants to keep Ryan alive for his parents. However, he has already been sent into the heartland of Zerg territory and lost contact due to the fog of war. The player assembled an elite team aimed to save Marine Ryan.</p> <p>The above clumsy imitation reveals the tremendous potential of combining traditional game mechanics with sophisticated system design.</p> <p>The Great Fault Tolerance is another unique characteristic of the rules in Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG). In most games, losing is frustrating and keeps players repeating the same gaming process until they beat it. Such things would not happen in Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG). Of course, I don't mean to say that narrative sandbox games are all simple and that players will never fail. In fact, the opposite is true. If measured by the standards of traditional mechanism games, most of them have a certain degree of difficulty, and players' gaming experiences are often accompanied by failure.</p> <p>!!! quote \u201cMotto in Dwarf Fortress\" The losing is fun.</p> <p>In NSG, the player can define their own loss and win conditions. The loss in other games here is treated as a different gaming branch. Some unique joy of the game can often only be experienced through losing. This is also why game streamers love these types of games\u2014failure in the game often leads to unexpected entertainment value.</p> <p>In Crusader Kings, the player can be a good ruler through mastering all the rules. If the player is overwhelmed by the complicated system, wasted years in the game and did nothing remarkable, then watching the kingdom fall can also be another kind of experience. Remember what I said before? The lack of knowledge about how to play would not be an issue for players; it can become a meaningful part of their gaming journey.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/16/the-narrative-sandbox-game/#emergent-story","title":"Emergent Story","text":"<p>Finally, we reach the top layer of Narrative Sandbox Game (NSG), the final product of gameplay, The Story.

This weird sensation must mean something, so I figured I\u2019d jot it down.</p> <p>There\u2019s this grape, \u201cSunshine Rose,\u201d originally from Japan, popping up locally this year. Seven years ago, its price was so outrageous it scared people off. The first time I tried it, \u201cout of this world\u201d doesn\u2019t even cut it\u2014each grape felt like falling deeper into some delicious abyss.</p> <p>Thanks to China\u2019s imports and local cultivation, the price has been dropping year by year.

Is this not straight-up wizardry?</p> <p>It jogs my memory of a trading game where a scarce item forced me to cough up way more than it was worth to seal a deal. That left me with this gut-punch sense of scarcity. For ages afterward, whenever I saw that item, I\u2019d get this itch to buy it, even if I didn\u2019t need it anymore.</p> <p>It hit me: that saying, \u201cfeelings transcend time and space,\u201d is real. At certain moments, those emotions come rushing back. I can picture it\u2014every trading experience carries the baggage of countless past moments, blurring the lines between game worlds and real life, creating this flow of feelings.</p> <p>To me, no designer can hijack a player\u2019s mind.

The moment you start naming something new, it\u2019s like you\u2019re holding the reins of destiny\u2014thrilling, yet terrifying, as if one wrong move could tank everything. So, you tread lightly, right? I\u2019ve thumbed through countless design books, but when it\u2019s time to tackle a real project, my brain just stalls, and all my clever ideas vanish into thin air. I used to envy those slick designers who could rattle off case studies, laying out how they meticulously crafted a killer product. Only later did I realize those moments I coveted were just curated snippets of the design hustle\u2014my idealized version of work, not the gritty reality.</p> <p>A few days ago, I got this sudden urge to design a logo for our Jing Games Studio. Maybe it was the lingering inspiration from my recent trip to Japan\u2019s Seto Inland Sea, where those intricate Japanese patterns were still swirling in my head. Coincidentally, I\u2019d just flipped through a quirky Japanese design book, and its pattern section sparked some fleeting, unshakable inspiration.</p> <p>Clinging to those faint vibes, I felt compelled to do something. But the second I started sketching, that familiar frustration came roaring back. This time, though, as I began drawing the logo, a strange heaviness crashed over me, layering onto that initial sense of grandeur. It was like I\u2019d morphed into a solemn judge wielding a pen, every stroke deciding the life or death of some cosmic fate. Under this weight, every move felt stiff, every bold idea like it was headed for the creative chopping block. It was as if the world split open, and I was a lone needle stuck in the gap\u2014unable to move forward or back, stewing in a self-inflicted sense of despair.</p> <p>But let\u2019s be real: this is just a logo sketch, a flat image. It could be as simple as a circle. Whatever it is, it\u2019s just a starting point, not a destiny-altering blockbuster. Everything exists for a reason, so no matter what this logo ends up looking like, it\u2019ll fulfill its purpose. And fulfilling that purpose? That\u2019s its own kind of triumph.</p> <p>Note: This is just a design sketch, meant to capture my shifting mindset during the process, not the final logo for Jing Games Studio.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""}]}
