Dear DevLog,

We are Yukai and Loomi, a couple who spent years creating our game Indulgence. This is the first letter to you, and it's long overdue. I know we should have been here from the start, writing down every bit of the game, sharing our joy, frustration, and even anger along the way. But why didn't we?

<!-- more -->

The truth is, we were scared. Fear held us back—fear that our game isn’t good enough, that we aren’t good enough. I can give you many reasons for our long-time absence: we are not native English speakers, we are too busy, the game is not in good shape yet, or the long grind drained our confidence and vitality. But deep in our hearts, I know they're all excuses; we are not honest enough to face you or ourselves. Now we're choosing the right path, starting with this letter.

Writing feels old-fashioned in a world of short videos, and few people used to read large paragraphs of text anymore. That's okay, it's not about promotion. Writing helps us untangle our jumbled thoughts and put them in order. It’s cheap, quick, and honest, free from the temptation to sugarcoat things for likes. For you, it’s easier to digest—no pausing a video to catch up. This is our space to reflect, to face our journey head-on.

We're self-taught developers, which explains why it took so long to develop. We do believe our game has some creative sparks, but I am not sure if all the shining points can make it a fun game. Even right now, I can only say the toughest parts are done, but there are still many things to do before it's playable. We're not even sure who our players are yet. We thought players who enjoy Dwarf Fortress might also like our story generator. For now, we leave the game details for later, before the rising anxiety makes me unable to write.

This letter is our hello, to let you know we're ready to face you. We will write more to explain our game, share our highs and lows, and hopefully, to show you the playable version of the game. See you soon, and thank you for your patience.

Sincerely,

Yukai & Loomi
